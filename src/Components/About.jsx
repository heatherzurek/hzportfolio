            <p class="paraFormat">My pronouns are <span class="highlight">she/her</span>. I'm a <span class="highlight">.NET Technical Support Engineer</span> at New Relic, with a background in C#, .NET, JavaScript, Node.js, and React. I work closely with .NET frameworks and SQL, but have an excitement and passion for frontend development. I enjoy learning new technologies, and there is never a shortage of things to learn. I am based in the beautiful <span class="highlight">Pacific Northwest</span>, where I spend my summers hiking, camping, and exploring National Parks with my husband, and my spring/fall/winters trying to stay dry by staying inside and watching tv shows, programming or playing games(console or board!).</p>
